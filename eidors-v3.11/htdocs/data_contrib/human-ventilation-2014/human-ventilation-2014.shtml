   <tr><th valign="top"> Brief Description:
       <td> 
These data are a brief sample of breathing in a healthy
human, tested by Swisstom AG as part of system evaluation.
The data represent a few tidal breaths as well as
expiratory and inspiratory breath holds.
<br>
The data were measured on the same subject as the
GREIT chest model given in this tutorial
<a href="../../tutorial/GREIT/adult_ex.shtml"
>GREIT Reconstruction for an adult human thorax geometry</a>

       <td>
EIT data were acquired with an early (2014) version of the Swisstom
BB<sup>2</sup> device at a sample rate
of 28.13 frames/s.
The excitation frequency was 144 kHz, current 3 mA.

   <tr><th valign="top"> Methods:
       <td>
A Swisstom Patient belt was attached to
the seated subject and connected to the
EIT system. The subject performed various
breathing manoeuvres while data were collected.

Waveforms vs time (s), of the global (sum) signal, as 
well as pixel waveforms at vertical locations
corresponding to a horizonal pixel #22.
The variations in pulsatility as well as
tidal excursions are seen.
